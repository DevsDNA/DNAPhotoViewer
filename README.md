# DNAPhotoViewer

DNAPhotoViewer is a slideshow and image viewer that includes double-tap to zoom, customizable headers and footer, support for multiple images, interactive flick to dismiss, animated zooming presentation, and more.

It has been ported to c# from the original [NYTPhotoViewer](https://github.com/NYTimes/NYTPhotoViewer), the one that New York Times uses on its app.
